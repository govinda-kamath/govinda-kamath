<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a fifth year doctoral student at the <a href="http://www-isl.stanford.edu/index.html">Information Systems Lab</a> at Stanford,
working with Prof. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~dntse/">David Tse</a>. Most of my work during my doctoral studies has
been on developing fast (that is almost linear time) machine learning algorithms for tackling various problems in computational genomics.
Prior to this I did get a ME in Electrical Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of science, where I worked with Prof. <a href="http://ece.iisc.ernet.in/~vijay/">P Vijay Kumar</a> on designing and proving optimality results of codes related to Distributed Storage Systems.</p>
<p>I've also been involved in TA-ing and helping develop a new course 
<a href="http://data-science-sequencing.github.io/">Data science for high throughput sequencing</a> taught by my adviser David Tse.
We discuss various problems in computational genomics, the different ways of modelling them and solving them. We 
cover a variety of tools from statistics, computer science and information theory that have been instrumental in
tackling these problems. </p>
<p>I'm passionate about making empirical components of my research easily reproducible. <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a> 
have been a godsend in that context, and has enabled me improve the ease of reproducing of some of my more
recent work quite drastically.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>During my doctoral studies, the following are a sample of the problems I have worked on. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Genome assembly</b>: The genome of an organism is a long strings of A,C,T,G. 
Current sequencing technology allows us to obtain noisy substrings of the genome called reads from the genome. 
These noisy reads are of length around 10,000 while the genome is of length in millions or billions.
Assembling the genome from reads is a fundamental problem of computational genomics. 
I worked on this from both a theoretic and a practical perspective.<br />
Genome assembly is constrained by repeats in the genome. We realised that the output of an assembler should 
be a graph where every sequence corresponding to a genome is an eulerian cycle 
(or an eulerian tour if the genome is linear). We wrote a practical assembler called <a href="https://github.com/HingeAssembler/HINGE">HINGE</a> 
which was published in <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/5/747">Genome Research</a>, 
and is still under active development with quite a few users primarily doing bacterial genomics. The current focus here is reducing the memory footprint. The theoretic results, which showed goodness of simplified version of HINGE from a rate distortion perspective
were presented at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01941">International Symposium of Information Theory (ISIT)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Single Cell RNA-seq</b>: RNA is an intermediate compound often created as an intermediate between DNA and protein.
RNA transcripts are much smaller than DNA (of length tens of thousand instead of billions), and the number of 
molecule of each RNA transcript is dynamically varying with time (and the type of cell in the organism), while
all the cells in any organism has the same DNA. 
RNA-seq is a sequencing assay that sequences RNA rather than DNA. 
With advances in the bio-chemistry, researchers have been able to sequence RNA from single cells. 
This presents interesting computational problems, as there is very little RNA in each cell. 
The fact that millions of cells are sequenced and each cell has an expression (feature vector) of tens
of thousands of dimensions makes the problem more challenging.<br />
One basic application of this technology is to be able to cluster cells from their RNA-seq reads. 
We developed an equivalence class based method that does this with significant computational 
savings over conventional methods. This was published in 
<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0970-8">Genome Biology</a>. <br /></p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Adaptive Monte-Carlo Optimization</b>:
One particular clustering algorithm that seems to be ideal for single-cell-RNA-seq data is k-medoids 
as opposed to k-means. This is because the data is sparse and the centroid is not an ideal representative of the cluster. Further
there has been a lot of interest in clustering this data using distances other than squared euclidean distances.
gene expressions are sparse. The main bottle neck here was that computing the medoid took superlinear time. We 
developed an algorithm: med-dit to compute medoids in almost linear time. This has been accepted for publication
in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00817">AISTATS-2018</a>. The algorithm is based on a connection between the 
combinatorial optimisation problem of finding medoids and the multi-armed bandits framework that we discovered
and exploited. 
We were able to extend these ideas to speed up a wide range of machine learning algorithms, such as
k-Nearest Neighbours, k-means, heirarchical clustering in a framework that we call 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08321">Adaptive Monte-Carlo Optimization</a>. This is under review at NIPS-2018.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Haplotype Assembly</b>: Humans and other higher organisms are diploid, 
that is they have two copies of their genome. These two copies  are almost identical 
with some polymorphic sites and regions (less than 0.3% of the genome). 
The problem here is to estimate which of the polymorphisms are on the same copy of a chromosome. 
We attacked this in two theoretic frameworks. 
The first was noting that this was a convolutional code, and the second was posing this as a community detection problem. 
These were published at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01975">ISIT-2015</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03828">ICML-2016</a>. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other problems I've dabbled with include trying to understand deep neural nets in the context of
information theoretic and computational genomics problems (like the problem of finding DNA motifs binding
with proteins). </p>
